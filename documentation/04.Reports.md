## Reporting
As administrators of the website you can view the monthly stats of the donations and download detail report for all the subscriptions and payments. The report is in CSV format and can be opened with LibreOffice, OpenOffice or something else like the MS Excel. From there you can add filtered for the columns and filter only by the active subscription. This way you can view only the subscriptions that are currently supporting your animals and get info about the emails with the updates you need to send (there will be also a column about the gift emails which will be different from the original account if a gift email was added).
