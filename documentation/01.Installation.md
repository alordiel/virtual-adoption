## Installation
### Requirements
The plugin will require:
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* WordPress 5.9 or higher

### Manual installation
Currently, the plugin is not in the WordPress Plugin's repo, which means that it should be installed manually. The archive file (zip) will need to be added as a new plugin from the admin panel of the WordPress site  (usually this will be `/wp-admin/plugin-install.php`). From the top select "Upload Plugin" and browse the zip file. After the upload you will need to activate the plugin. 
### WPML Support
The plugin can work with WPML for multiple languages, but you need to make the post-type `sheltered-animal` and the taxonomy `kind-of-animal` translatable from within the WPML settings.
