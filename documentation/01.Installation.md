## Installation
### Requirements
The plugin will require:
* PHP 7.4 or higher
* WordPress 5.9 or higher

### Manual installation
Currently, the plugin is not in the WordPress Plugin's repo, which means that it should be installed manually. The archive file (zip) will need to be added as a new plugin from the admin panel of the WordPress site  (usually this will be `/wp-admin/plugin-install.php`). From the top select "Upload Plugin" and browse the zip file. After the upload you will need to activate the plugin. 

### What will happen with activation of the plugin?
Once the plugin is activated some pre-set-up functions will be triggered. A new database will be added (`{wp-prefix}va_subscriptions`), which will be used for storing details about the subscriptions and some PayPal related data.

Few pages will be autogenerated ("Thank you" page, "Checkout" page, "Login" page, "My subscriptions" page). The related to them template files will be connected.

Two log files will be created in `/wp-uploads/virtual-adoptions/`. On that will keep records of successful events and one that will track the error logs.

Three new post types will be created. Pending, Active and Cancelled statuses will be related to the subscriptions and their state.
