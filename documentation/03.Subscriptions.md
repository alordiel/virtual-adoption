## Subscriptions
### Creating new subscription
The creation of a new subscription is a process that would require a user's account to be created. The user will pick up an animal which s/he would like to support. On the checkout page a registration form will be presented (or a login option). Once the user is logged in the options with the payment amounts will be displayed. There is also an option for adding a gift email to which the animal's updates will be sent to, so the user can gift the virtual adoption to someone else.

The payment method is done only by PayPal, but it supports both a standard PayPal payment and card payment. The subscription will be for the selected amount as monthly payment limited to 24 months.

On successful payment the user will be redirected to "Thank you" page. You can edit its content. 

### Cancelling the subscription plan
If only one monthly payment fails then the whole subscription will be cancelled.
The users can manage their subscription from withing the account of your site, where they can review the list of their sponsored animals. From there they can initiate a subscription's cancellation or cancel the subscription from within their PayPal's account.
